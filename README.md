# Ex-5-RECOGNITION-OF-THE-GRAMMAR-anb-where-n-10-USING-YACC
RECOGNITION OF THE GRAMMAR(anb where n>=10) USING YACC
# Date:6/5/2025
# Aim:
To write a YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10.
# ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3.	In the lex program, write the translation rules for the variables a and b.
4.	Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5.	Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6.	Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc â€“d arith_id.y
7.	Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8.	Enter a string as input and it is identified as valid or invalid.
# PROGRAM:
%{
#include "y.tab.h"
%}

%%
a   { return A; }
b   { return B; }
\n  { return '\n'; }
.   { return yytext[0]; }
%%

int yywrap() {
    return 1;
}

# RESULT
The YACC program to recognize the grammar anb where n>=10 is executed successfully and the output is verified.
